## Tags
There are different tags in master branch, that correspond (some how) with each chapter in the book. I mostly follow the book, but some times I introduced changes.

### Chapter01
Here just add the basic structure to work with Webpack, Babel, React, ESLint, PostCSS and other technologies.

### Chapter02
Here we started using React. We added two React components, one of them stateless. We define the concepts `State`, `Props`, and `Events` and use them in the components.

### Chapter03
Production Optimize Webpack: Optimizing React code, separating CSS for static or CDN serving, bundling dependencies separately, minifying JavaScript code, and others.

### Chapter04
We started designing our very own ReactSpeed UI component library for our apps. We did so using Flexbox, PostCSS, and custom React components.

### Chapter05
This stage is to speedily “prototype” new features and code within our React project. We will go over best practices to create performant, reusable, and maintainable code.
